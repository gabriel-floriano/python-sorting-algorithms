# Sorting Algorithms Performance Analysis

This repository contains Python implementations of various sorting algorithms, which were developed and tested for the paper *Análise de Desempenho dos Algoritmos de Ordenação* submitted to the Universidade da Região de Joinville (UNIVILLE). The paper presents a comparative analysis of sorting algorithms, evaluating their performance based on execution time across different input sizes.

## Algorithms Implemented

The following sorting algorithms are included in this repository:

- **Bubble Sort**
- **Improved Bubble Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Shell Sort**
- **Selection Sort**
- **Heap Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Radix Sort**
- **Counting Sort**
- **Bucket Sort**

Each algorithm was tested using three different input sizes: 10,000, 50,000, and 100,000 elements. The performance of these algorithms was analyzed based on their execution time for different input sizes.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to provide a comparative analysis of the sorting algorithms, focusing on:

- **Computational Complexity**
- **Execution Time** for different input sizes
- **Advantages and Disadvantages** of each algorithm

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NumPy

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
